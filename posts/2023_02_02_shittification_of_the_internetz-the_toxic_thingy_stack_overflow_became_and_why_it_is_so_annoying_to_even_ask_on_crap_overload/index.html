<h2 id="stackoverflow----you-want-help--you-get-downvotes"><code>Stackoverflow</code> -  you want help ? you get downvotes</h2>
<p>Somehow people might be attracted by Stack Overflow ,</p>
<ul>
<li>maybe because it&rsquo;s mostly top-ranked by Search Engines,</li>
<li>maybe because sometimes it really helps ,</li>
<li>maybe it keeps people in business that should better do stuff without brain-usage or something where they cannot harm people.</li>
</ul>
<p>But over the years it has become a dirt-pool <strong>that is quicker in instant-downvoting and duplicate-flagging</strong> than answering.</p>

<p>Maybe that is what happens when platforms tend to be &ldquo;up/down-vote&rdquo;-style places full of  Mr./Mrs.-always-right &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>people that post and are downvoted just because of &ldquo;how the answer was &quot; just leave or don&rsquo;t post anymore, leaving the self-confirming &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; to play their toxic games</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ZK0t9-llo"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>There is a youtube Video that has some painful examples of what is going on over there</a> , stories where people are <strong>rewarded to remove their questions</strong> (WTF!)</p>
<p>In the description there is a <strong>very</strong> true statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stack Overflow culture <strong>needs to be fixed</strong>. The overall <strong>gatekeeping &amp; elitism</strong> in computer science &amp; programming - as a whole - needs to be fixed. <strong>I just see it more on Stack Overflow than anywhere else</strong> .</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>the internet is full of threads that ask why a bunch of bullies is dominating on SO</p>
<p>And to sum it up <a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/9pgc1a/why_is_asking_on_stackoverflow_so_horrible/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>there is a reddit that says it all </a>, so here are some quotes ( of more than 1 user ) from that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In return for my technical question, I get what <strong>amounts to a colonoscopy, by what appear to be 14 year old &ldquo;engineers&rdquo;, who racked up internet points asserting wrong information with brazen confidence</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is everyone <strong>responding in underhanded, condescending tone, under a thin veil of technical clarification?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that people <strong>who don&rsquo;t know the answer, nor care to even understand the question, need to comment, then upvote their incorrect comments, all meanwhile downvoting my question?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>..  <strong>asking a question on SO is equivalent to giving up whatever dignity you have, or be downvoted</strong> for <em>no logical reason</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SO has always had a problem with toxicity. I think the <strong>main reason for this is that it&rsquo;s not actually a Q&amp;A platform. It&rsquo;s a wiki under the guise of a Q&amp;A platform</strong>. This explains why people can edit your posts and why ++SO explicitly encourages users to post questions that they already have the answer to**.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SO doesn&rsquo;t want people to post questions asking for help. They want people to create Q&amp;A-style wiki pages to add to their curated collection of knowledge. If your question doesn&rsquo;t have a good answer of general use to the populous, then it&rsquo;ll be downvoted and closed because it&rsquo;s not useful to them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, people innocently try to get help on the site and are subsequently berated and their questions torn apart</strong>. SO has tried to address this issue, but it seems that they haven&rsquo;t made any progress.
<strong>The first rule of SO is NEVER EVER ask questions on it. It&rsquo;ll get down voted and marked as duplicate immediately.</strong>
<strong>It&rsquo;s a great reference. Absolutely terrible source of help.</strong></p>

<p><a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/tf7ec3/stackoverflow_has_too_many_selfrighteous/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>A reddit has some user-horror-stories and a lot of criticism</a> about the self-righteous moderators and that they act as if they were the north-korean authorities, here are some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stackoverflow lives from the contribution of thousands contributors, <strong>but is controlled by a small band of moderators who have dictatorship like powers</strong> &hellip; Of course, it is good that Stackoverflow tries to enforce a certain level of quality for its content, but having this &ldquo;police&rdquo; punishing others leads to the same problem like any other police has: <strong>They feel they are omnipotent and always right, even if they are wrong</strong>. I wish Stackoverflow would be more supporting of their content provider and help them to improve their contribution <strong>instead of removing content with wrong justifications and no easy way to challenge that</strong> .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One tool these <strong>moderators like to use to suppress a discussion</strong> is to <strong>mark a question as duplicate, which means the question/answers get closed, no further discussion is possible</strong>. They <strong>just pretend that a many year old question sounds similar</strong> . The worst example I have seen: A question asked why he gets a null reference in a specific WPF situation. The <strong>question got marked as duplicate</strong>, because someone had posted 100 reasons why a null reference can happen, <strong>but with zero relevance for WPF</strong>. There was a good reason why the null reference exception happened in this particular situation, <strong>but it was no longer possible to add an answer</strong> explaining why the problem happen. And <strong>normal mortals have no chance to overturn the duplicate decision</strong>, for that you need to have a tons of points on Stackoverflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>.. problem started when my answer got deleted with the reason &quot; Code plagiarised without attribution&rdquo;, which was wrong in my opinion . Since my original answer got deleted, you cannot see in that link, that&rsquo;s how censorship works on Stackoverflow. I wrote all the content myself, except at the very end where I pasted some WPF source code. I made it clear that this was not my code and where it is coming from&hellip; <strong>clearly stated that I could not write this code and that it is WPF source code</strong>. How can this be plagiarism ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am using Stackoverflow since many years but I really could not figure out how to appeal this decision. So I tried to raise the issue on Meta: <a class="link" href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/416605/how-to-get-an-answer-deleted-by-a-moderator-because-of-code-plagiarized-withou"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/416605/how-to-get-an-answer-deleted-by-a-moderator-because-of-code-plagiarized-withou</a>. I did this reluctantly due to my earlier experience with self-righteous moderators, who usually react aggressively when anyone dares to mention that there was a problem on Stackoverflow. I wonder if they feel personally questioned and go into defense/attack mode automatically &hellip; got there comments like &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to quote and cite your sources when writing any professional document? I find that hard to believe.&rdquo; Well, the truth is that I have never written a professional document citing sources. As it is common on Meta, <strong>many commenters do not consider if the case presented has any merit</strong> (i.e. I did write in my answer that it is not my code and where I got it from). Instead they like to <strong>attack the person who dares to question their actions</strong>&hellip; To <strong>suppress any further discussion</strong>, the <strong>moderators</strong> used their preferred weapon and <strong>marked my Meta post as duplicate, even the other question had completely different circumstances</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since they didn&rsquo;t like me raising my question on Meta, <strong>they also marked my original question as duplicate</strong>. Please note that my <strong>question had gone already through a review process and was accepted as proper. Only after I raised it on Meta my original question was closed</strong> because of &ldquo;This question needs details or clarity&rdquo;. Again, <strong>no easy option to appeal the decision</strong>. The <strong>only action they allow is that I change my question</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the replies, users have <strong>more horrific stories</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.. once asked a question <strong>that took hours to write and referenced 5 different approaches to the problem</strong>, and all I got was a <strong>downvote without explanation</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>stack overflow has at this point <strong>deleted as much useful content as it currently contains</strong>&hellip; there were always attitude issues amongst the power users, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less, <strong>but when they started getting militant about the definition of subjective and combining loosely related topics as duplicate</strong> then later *<strong>deleting the question the defined as the original as low quality</strong> it started to go downhill pretty fast</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SO has become a place where dictatorship is rife, people are unfriendly and there is too much moderation going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>StackOverflow has become a slightly less spammy version of Experts Exchange. <strong>It&rsquo;s woefully out of date on most things, gives bad and/or conflicting advice on everything else</strong>, and generally has become a useless pile of junk. And most of the reason is what you&rsquo;ve described here. The <strong>moderator fiefdoms result in petty turf wars and bad comments rise to the top because of political reasons</strong> rather than technical ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Someone read your answer&rdquo;, no they did not read it, they <strong>just posted competitive answer and after they realized they need a little bit more reputation</strong> (for what?!) and my answer is already upvoted (more important to them then to me), they <strong>started plagiarism story</strong>. Couple hour later, <strong>moderator that also did not check ANYTHING (answer, profile, links&hellip;) deleted my post</strong>. There is no reason for any kind of &ldquo;we are just trying to protect our company&rdquo; action, but on the contrary: people are decreasing SO reputation because they need just to distinguish themselves, not to help people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fyi Stack overflow is really old &hellip;  Is <strong>still uses Windows Server and MSSQL</strong></p>

<p><a class="link" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-bad-about-Stack-Overflow"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>On Quora .. different place , same story</a></p>
<p>To also cite the &ldquo;highlights&rdquo;(dark spots) of SO from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs the dumbest web-site I‚Äôve ever seen. They should help people but they kept closing my questions for no reason, even banned me from asking more.</strong> I am asking BECAUSE I am not a pro. I always tried to be concise and clear, <strong>their stupid bots just closed many of my questions</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>voting system on Stack Overflow is that it penalizes users</strong>. It only takes <strong>a few negative votes to get you banned from asking questions</strong>, taking part on the platform. In my experience, <strong>rarely do downvotes get removed</strong> from questions that have been improved through editing. <strong>Even &ldquo;deleting&rdquo; questions will not remove their negative score on one&rsquo;s account.</strong> &hellip; ** the strict gamification** of Stackoverflow, <strong>turning users into winners and losers</strong>, creates an <strong>overall unwelcoming, precarious attitude towards beginner programmers</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>it‚Äôs sh*t</strong>, and I will use the word <strong>totalitarian</strong>, Stack Overflow (regarding its coding forums side) <strong>is a totalitarian place</strong>, the totalitarianism is <strong>first handled by the people who run SO</strong>.</p>
